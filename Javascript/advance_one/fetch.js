// The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, 
// the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request 

//interview question
// The fetch() function will reject the promise on some errors,
//  but not if the server responds with an error status like 404:
//  so we also check the response status and throw if it is not OK.
