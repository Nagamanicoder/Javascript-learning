# javascript and classes 

# the  Javascript is a prototype based language
# internally, the javscript doesnot have the oop based 

## OOP 

## Onject 
- collection of properties and methods 
- example: Date, promise 

## why use OOP 
- The code was messed up and the code was not readable , reusable

## Components or parts of OOP 

Object literal 

- Construcor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars
- Abstarction 
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism 

1. Encapsulation

- Why: protect state, control access.
- Data is not directly modified.
- Changes happen only via methods.

2. Abstraction

- Why: reduce mental load.
- User doesn’t care how it works.
- Only what it does matters.

3. Inheritance

- Why: avoid duplication.
- Child gets parent behavior.
- Can extend or override.

4. Polymorphism

- Why: write generic code.
- Same method name.
- Different output based on object.
